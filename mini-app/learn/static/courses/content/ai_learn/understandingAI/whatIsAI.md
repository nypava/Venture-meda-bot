## What is AI?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and self-correction. Essentially, it's about creating machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.

AI is a broad field encompassing several subfields, including:

* **Machine Learning (ML):** Enables systems to learn from data without explicit programming.
* **Deep Learning (DL):** A subset of ML using neural networks with multiple layers.
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Enables computers to understand and process human language.
* **Computer Vision (CV):** Enables computers to "see" and interpret images and videos.

The goal of AI is to create intelligent machines that can solve problems, make decisions, and perform tasks with human-like capabilities.
