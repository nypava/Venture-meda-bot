## What is Web3?

Web3, often described as the next iteration of the internet, aims to create a decentralized and user-controlled web. It builds upon the foundations of blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies, and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) to shift power away from centralized corporations and back to individual users.

**Key Characteristics of Web3:**

* **Decentralization:** Web3 applications (dApps) run on decentralized networks, like blockchains, rather than centralized servers. This reduces reliance on single points of control.
* **Blockchain Technology:** Blockchain provides a secure and transparent ledger for recording transactions and data.
* **Cryptocurrencies:** Cryptocurrencies are used as native tokens within Web3 ecosystems, facilitating transactions and incentivizing participation.
* **NFTs:** NFTs enable ownership and transfer of unique digital assets, such as art, music, and virtual real estate.
* **User Ownership:** Users have greater control over their data and digital assets.
* **Permissionless Access:** Web3 aims to provide open and permissionless access to applications and services.
* **Semantic Web:** Web3 incorporates semantic web technologies, enabling machines to better understand and process information.

In essence, Web3 seeks to create a more open, transparent, and equitable internet where users have greater control over their online experiences.
