## How Web3 is Different from Web2

Web3 represents a significant departure from the current state of the internet, known as Web2. Here's a breakdown of the key differences:

**Web2 (Current Internet):**

* Centralized: Dominated by large corporations that control data and services.
* Data Ownership: Users generate data, but corporations own and monetize it.
* Permissioned Access: Many services require accounts and are subject to terms of service.
* Advertising-Driven: Business models often rely on targeted advertising based on user data.
* Limited User Control: Users have limited control over their data and online experiences.

**Web3 (Decentralized Internet):**

* Decentralized: Built on decentralized networks, reducing reliance on central authorities.
* Data Ownership: Users own and control their data and digital assets.
* Permissionless Access: Open and accessible to anyone, without needing permission from a central authority.
* Token-Based Economies: Uses cryptocurrencies and NFTs to incentivize participation and create new economic models.
* Increased User Control: Users have greater control over their data, privacy, and online interactions.

**Key Differences Summarized:**
