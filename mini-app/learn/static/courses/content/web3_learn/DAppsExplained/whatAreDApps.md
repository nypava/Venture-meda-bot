## What Are DApps?

DApps, or Decentralized Applications, are applications that run on a decentralized network, typically a blockchain. Unlike traditional apps that rely on centralized servers, DApps operate on a peer-to-peer network, offering greater transparency, security, and user control.

**Key Characteristics:**

* **Open Source:** DApps are typically open source, meaning their code is publicly available and verifiable.
* **Decentralized:** They operate on a decentralized network, reducing reliance on single points of control.
* **Cryptographic Security:** They use cryptography to secure data and transactions.
* **Tokenization:** Many DApps utilize native tokens for various functions within the application.
* **Autonomous Operation:** Smart contracts, self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code, are often used to automate processes.
* **Immutable Data:** Data stored on the blockchain is immutable, meaning it cannot be altered.

**Examples of DApps:**

* Decentralized exchanges (DEXs)
* Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms
* Blockchain-based games
* NFT marketplaces
* Decentralized social media platforms

DApps represent a shift towards a more user-centric and transparent internet.
